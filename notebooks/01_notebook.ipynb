    "A qubit is the fundamental unit of quantum information. In quantum computing, logical operations are designed to act on qubits, treating them as idealized, perfectly isolated quantum systems—often referred to as pure or closed states. However, in real-world quantum hardware, qubits are susceptible to imperfections caused by environmental noise and other disturbances. To address these challenges, quantum error correction and mitigation techniques are employed separately. This distinction ensures that the core principles of quantum computing remain universal and independent of specific hardware constraints."

    "Quantum logic gates are fundamental operations that manipulate qubits by transforming their quantum states.

    "## Quantum circuits\n",
    "n quantum computing, algorithms are implemented by combining quantum logic gates into structured quantum circuits. These circuits follow a fundamental three-stage process: encoding input data, executing computations, and extracting results through measurement.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step, encoding the input, involves preparing the initial quantum state by applying specific gates that map classical information onto qubits. This stage is crucial because different problems require different ways of encoding data, ensuring that the quantum system begins in a state suited for computation. Once the input is set, the circuit proceeds to the execution phase, where a sequence of quantum gates manipulates the qubits according to the algorithm’s logic. Unlike classical computation, this process leverages the principles of superposition, entanglement, and quantum interference, allowing quantum circuits to explore multiple computational paths simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the measurement stage collapses the quantum state, converting the qubits into classical bits that can be read as output. Because quantum measurement is inherently probabilistic, multiple runs of the same circuit may be needed to obtain reliable results. While the gates responsible for encoding the input must change whenever a different dataset is used, the core computational operations remain the same for a given algorithm. This separation of input preparation from execution enhances the modularity and adaptability of quantum circuits, making them powerful tools for solving a wide range of computational problems."
